# vim-docker

This was previously a mirror of [github.com/docker/docker/contrib/syntax/vim](https://github.com/docker/docker/tree/master/contrib/syntax/vim), but in [docker/docker@5511f45](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/5511f45767e78b136c292dbb989296fb6e4d12fc), that entire directory was deprecated in favor of `ftplugin/dockerfile.vim` and `syntax/dockerfile.vim` in [github.com/vim/vim](https://github.com/vim/vim).

The [`docker` branch](https://github.com/tianon/vim-docker/commits/docker) contains the old Docker-based commit history.

The [`vim` branch](https://github.com/tianon/vim-docker/tree/vim) contains the new Vim-based commit history (and is now the useful one to include/use via vim-pack, etc).
